### 1. Place the Variplaits on a scale
First you need to decicde on the final weight of your variplaits. Typically weights we recommend are 140g which is the weight of the micro plate alone. Then 250g, there is a special bag containing only 110g of filler (110g + 140g = 250g). This bag is marked with an X. Use this bag first please. All other bags contains 125 of filler. So you can go for 140g, 250g, 375g, 500g, 625g. We recommend to use a scale for high precision! But you can also trust the weights of the filler bags.

### 2. Use the funnel to fill the filler
In the package is also a small funnel, which support the easy and clean filling of the fractional plates. Simply put in the whole of the micro plate. It designed to stand alone. 

### 3. Fill the filler
Now start slowly filling the filler in the variplaites. Every now and then shake the micro plates to let the filler sit. Shake and knock the fractional plates on the table thoroughly.  

### 4. Use the sticker.
Once you reached the desired weight immediatly seal the macro plates with delivered tapes seals.
